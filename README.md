- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MichaelKarnesDev! I am an active duty Corporal in the USMC. I currently work as a cyber security analyist for the Marine Corps Cyberspace Operations Group.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in just about everything related to software development. I crave a wholistic understanding of the development lifecycle, and hope drill down on one area in the coming years.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Native, cloud security as it relates to AWS, and Java!
